# HTTP made even easier.

## A simple tutorial, providing code and context.

Writing a _simple_ tutorial explaining HTTP is nothing but _simple_.

To achieve this goal, some material has to be omitted. We will focus on the basic functionnality of th HyperText Transfert Protocol.

This howto is written with web developers in mind. It is not for programmers interested in developping HTTP librairies. We will assume a certain level of abstraction that is provided by most modern http-aware programming languages.

### Some assumptions

* You searched the internet for "http tutorial" and found the document at [http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/]. Altought you could follow along a bit, you don't want to have anything to do with sockets or CGI...

* You have a basic understanding of the web. You know your **browser** _calls_ a **server** to get a _page_ (there is much more to it, but at least you get that part). 

* You know that if you wanted to read the HTTP 1.1 specification, you could go to [http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html] (or you don't and even if you did, it would not help you much).

* You are ready to learn more (duh)!

### Overview of the main the main concepts

Quoting from "HTTP Made Really Easy" :

> Like most network protocols, HTTP uses the client-server model: An HTTP client opens a connection and sends a request message to an HTTP server; the server then returns a response message, usually containing the resource that was requested. After delivering the response, the server closes the connection (making HTTP a stateless protocol, i.e. not maintaining any connection information between transactions).
